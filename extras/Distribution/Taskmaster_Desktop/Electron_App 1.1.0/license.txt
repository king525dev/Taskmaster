     The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts 		             
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s. As a permissive license, it puts                            
only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.                       
                                                                           
     Unlike copyleft software licenses, the MIT License also permits reuse within proprietary 	             
software, provided that all copies of the software or its substantial portions include a 	             
copy of the terms of the MIT License and also a copyright notice. As of 2020, the 		             
MIT License was the most popular software license found in one analysis, continuing 		             
from reports in 2015 that the MIT License was the most popular software license on GitHub.

     Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System, Ruby on Rails, Nim, 	             
Node.js, Lua, and jQuery. Notable companies using the MIT License include Microsoft (.NET),                  
Google (Angular), and Meta (React).
